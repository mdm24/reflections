When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to work away from your local machine. It would allow you to pull your work to a different machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might want to be working on a older version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork- is used in git hub and is a quick way of getting a copy of someone elses repository. You can then modify the content which
does not change the original persons repository.
Clone- clone is used to make a copy of a repository onto your local machine.
Branches- are used to create different versions of the same repository. This means you can have different changes on different branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You are able to access the most up to date version of the program.
