When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to work away from your local machine. It would allow you to pull your work to a different machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might want to be working on a older version.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
Fork- is used in git hub and is a quick way of getting a copy of someone elses repository. You can then modify the content which
does not change the original persons repository.
Clone- clone is used to make a copy of a repository onto your local machine.
Branches- are used to create different versions of the same repository. This means you can have different changes on different branches.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
You are able to access the most up to date version of the program.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
I would meet with the other people in person to go over the code. It would be quicker and easier to communicate and discuss problems.
It would be harder to organise a time for everyone to meet up and therefore github can be helpful.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
When you want to experiment and make changes to the work without changing the original work. This allows you to experiment and potentially
improve your work without the fear of breaking your groups work. On the other hand it takes more time to merge the changes all together later.
