When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When you want to work away from your local machine. It would allow you to pull your work to a different machine.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Because you might want to be working on a older version.
