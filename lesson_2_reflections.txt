What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
You create a repository to save your work. Once created you have to commit to make a save point. 
You need it to initilize the whole repository and create a location.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
This is a stage where the files havnt been commited yet. This is the stage inbetween the working respository, where files are
chosen to be shipped away to be stored on the repository. This allows you to choose what files you want to be saved to the repository.
